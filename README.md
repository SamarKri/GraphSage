Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs

This project implements the GraphSAGE model with four types of aggregation (mean, max, sum, GCN) and allows comparison of its performance with DeepWalk across multiple datasets (Citeseer, PPI, and OpenAlex 🍀).
The project includes a comprehensive evaluation based on F1 score, recall, precision, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, along with embedding visualization.

Implementation of GraphSAGE based on the paper "Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs" by Hamilton et al., 2017
